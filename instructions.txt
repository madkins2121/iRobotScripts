Section 2: About iRobot Create

iRobot Create is a complete robot development kit that allows you to
program new robot behaviors without having to worry about mechanic
assembly and low-level code.  iRobot Create's Open Interface (OI)
provides you with a set of commands, such as "drive" commands, demo
commands, song commands and sensor commands, that encourage your own
inventiveness. With iRobot Create, you can develop new behaviors and
add third party electronics, all without having to worry about
mechanical robustness or low-level control.

When you first begin working with iRobot Create you may find its ten
built in demos useful as inspirations for your own ideas.  As you
become more comfortable with its abilities and interface you will want
to write your own Open Interface-based programs to control iRobot
Create using a serial connection from a PC or microprocessor such as
the iRobot Command Module.

You can attach and control other hardware and electronic devices to
iRobot Create; such as a robotic arm, light display, or a ranging
sensor. It can also become a musical instrument! By using the Song
command you can write and save up to 16 songs in iRobot Create. For
more information on iRobot Create's OI commands, including demos and
songs, refer to the iRobot Create Open Interface (OI) Specification
found at www.irobot.com/create.

Section 4: Preparing your Linux System for iRobot

(If you are using HackerSpace Computers, and testing your own program,
skip to step 4)

(If you are using HackerSpace Computers, and testing an example, skip
to step 5) (Otherwise, start from step 1)

1.)
This is written for Ubuntu and Fedora. If you are using another
distro, you'll need to find the packages yourself or compile them
yourself.

Install the following packages:

Ubuntu: "sudo apt-get install avrdude avr-libc gcc-avr"
Fedora: "sudo yum install avrdude avr-gcc avr-gcc-c++"

Remove this package or if it isn't installed, happily move on:

Ubuntu: "sudo apt-get remove brltty"
Fedora: "sudo yum remove brltty"

brltty is a background process which provides access to the Linux/Unix
console for a blind person using a refreshable braille display. It is
safe to remove unless your blind, then you should not even be reading
this.

2.)
Copy the examples from the CD that came with the iRobot Create or
download all the examples from HackerSpace. Put it somewhere on your
filesystem.

3.)
Inside the input directory of the examples, open the makefile and edit
the following lines:

Line 86:
Change from: DEBUG = dwarf-2
Change to: DEBUG = stabs

Line 201:
Change from: AVRDUDE_PROGRAMMER = stk500
Change to: AVRDUDE_PROGRAMMER = stk500v1

Line 204:
Change from: AVRDUDE_PORT = com9
Change to: AVRDUDE_PORT = /dev/ttyUSB0

(Since you are using a USB you must change your serial port = com9, to
USB = /dev/ttyUSB0)

(Depending on your USB connections, "ttyUSB0" might be different,
ex. ttyUSB1,ttyUSB2,etc..)

4.)
To build the project:

"make all"

5.)
To send it to the iRobot:

Ubuntu: "make program"
Fedora: "sudo make program"

____________________________________________________

Section 5: Testing the "input" example program

1.)
Remove the USB cable from the Command Module. Make
sure Create's serial cable is not plugged in.

2.)
Press the red Reset Button on the Command Module to start your program.

3.)
When the input program starts, two LEDs should flash slowly, one on
the Command Module and one on Create itself.  Press the Play button on
Create. It will play a song and light the Advance LED on Create solid
while the song is playing.

4.)
Press the soft button on the Command Module. Create
plays a different song and the LED on the Command Module
stays lit while itâ€™s playing.

Section 6: Creating your own project

The easiest way to start a project is to copy one of the example
programs and modify it for your own application.  For instance, the
framework for sending commands and reading sensors provided by the
drive example can be useful for most applications.To create your own
project based on the drive example, perform the following steps:

1.)
Copy drive.c, oi.h, and makefile from the drive example directory over
to your new project directory.

2.)
In the new directory, rename drive.c to the desired name for your new
program, such as myapp.c

3.)
Edit the makefile to reflect the new name of your
application. Specifically, you need to change the value of TARGET to
the name of your new application. On line 59 of the drive makefile,
youâ€™ll see the line: TARGET = drive Change this to the new name of
your application.  For example: TARGET = myapp

4.)
Next, change the behavior of the program to suit your new application
by changing the C code. In drive.c, the behavior of Create is defined
in the main function. Refer to Section 6 and Section 7 for more
details on examples. When you're ready with your code, repeat the
steps in Section 4.3-4.4 and Section 5.1-5.2 to set up your project
and to compile, download, and test your program.

Section 7: Command Module Examples

1.) Drive
The drive example program comes preprogrammed into the Command
Module. It demonstrates the basic capabilities of the Command Module
and the iRobot Create Open Inter face by driving around, reacting to
sensors, and using various inputs and outputs. It makes a series of
rising beeps when it is first powered to let you know the Command
Module is alive and blinks Createâ€™s LEDs (note that the program makes
Createâ€™s power LED orange). Then, if you place Create on the floor and
press the Command Moduleâ€™s soft button it starts driving on the floor,
backing up and turning when it runs into something with its bumper,
and blinking all LEDs in a pattern. To stop the program, press the
button again or simply pick it up.  The code provides useful function
to initialize the Command Module and iRobot Create, continuously read
Createâ€™s sensor values, drive Create, turn on Create, and change the
baud rate.

2.) Input
The input example program illustrates the three types of input and
output that you can use with the Command Module. You can interact with
hardware on iRobot Create through the Open Interface, use the built-in
Command Module hardware, and add your own hardware to the Command
Moduleâ€™s connectors.  This simple program flashes three LEDs, one on
each type of output, and waits for button presses on each type of
input. If it gets a button press, it lights the associated LED and
plays a song.

3.) Light(Light Sensor not included)

The light example program demonstrates a possible application for the
Command Module and iRobot Create. It searches your house for lights
which are left on and plays an alarm when it finds a light so that you
can turn it off. The program has all of Createâ€™s and Command Moduleâ€™s
LEDs turned on (note that Createâ€™s power LED will be orange) so that
itâ€™s easy to find in the dark.

Start it up in a relatively dark room by pressing the soft button. It
will sample the light level when it starts and will set off its alarm
when it detects a significantly brighter room.  To detect the light
level, the program uses a CDS light sensor which you need to add to
the Command Moduleâ€™s top center ePort, as described in Section 7. It
measures the light level from the sensor using one of the Command
Module's analog input pins.
